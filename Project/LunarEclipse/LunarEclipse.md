### **Explanation of Lunar Eclipse Animation Code**


### **1. Universal Styles**
```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
- **Universal Selector (`*`)**: 
  - Resets the margin and padding of all elements to `0` to ensure consistency across browsers.
  - `box-sizing: border-box;` ensures that padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height.

### **2. Body Styling**
```css
body {
  background-color: #ffe4d6;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
- **Background Color**: The body has a soft peach background (`#ffe4d6`), representing the Earth or the sky.
- **Size**: The body takes up the full viewport (`100vw` and `100vh`), and its content is centered using `display: flex` along with `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center`.

### **3. Universe (Sky) Styling**
```css
.universe {
  width: 40vw;
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  background-color: #ffbb5c;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border-radius: 12px;
  animation: skychange 8s ease infinite;
}
```
- **Size and Shape**: The `universe` div has a width of `40vw` (40% of the viewport width), and the `aspect-ratio: 1` ensures that the height equals the width, forming a square.
- **Background Color**: Initially set to a warm color (`#ffbb5c`), resembling the sunlit sky.
- **Centering**: The `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` center any content inside the `universe` div (in this case, the sun).
- **Border Radius**: Adds rounded corners to the `universe` div.
- **Animation**: The `skychange` animation changes the background color of the `universe` div, simulating the phases of the eclipse.

### **4. Skychange Animation**
```css
@keyframes skychange {
  0% {
    background-color: #ffbb5cb5;
  }
  25% {
    background-color: #fcbf49;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: #000000;
  }
  75% {
    background-color: #fcbf49;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: #ffbb5cb5;
  }
}
```
- This keyframe animation changes the color of the sky (`universe`):
  - **0% and 100%**: The sky is a soft peach color (`#ffbb5cb5`).
  - **25% and 75%**: The sky becomes a warm yellow (`#fcbf49`), simulating sunlight.
  - **50%**: The sky turns black (`#000000`), representing the eclipse's totality when the moon blocks the sun.
- The animation is set to run continuously (`infinite`), creating a repeating cycle of the lunar eclipse.

### **5. Sun Styling**
```css
.sun {
  width: 18vw;
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  background-color: #e25e3e;
  border-radius: 50%;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
- **Size and Shape**: The `sun` div is a circle with a width of `18vw`, and the `aspect-ratio: 1` ensures it remains circular.
- **Background Color**: The sun is a bright orange (`#e25e3e`).
- **Positioning**: `position: relative` is used to position the moon (the pseudo-element `::after`) inside the sun.
- **Overflow Hidden**: The sun's div hides anything that goes outside of its boundaries, such as the moon during the eclipse.

### **6. Moon Animation (Pseudo-element)**
```css
.sun::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: inherit;
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  border-radius: inherit;
  background-color: #000;
  animation: moonwalk 8s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```
- **Content**: The `::after` pseudo-element is used to create the moon inside the sun. It starts with no visible content but will animate to simulate the eclipse.
- **Positioning**: The `::after` pseudo-element is absolutely positioned inside the sun, covering it entirely.
- **Background Color**: The moon is black (`#000`), representing the moon blocking the sun.
- **Animation**: The `moonwalk` animation is applied to simulate the moon moving across the sun during the eclipse.

### **7. Moonwalk Animation**
```css
@keyframes moonwalk {
  0% {
    translate: 100%;
    scale: 1;
  }
  50% {
    translate: 0%;
    scale: 0.95;
    box-shadow: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5) 0px 48px 100px 0px;
  }
  100% {
    translate: -100%;
    scale: 0.9;
  }
}
```
- The `moonwalk` animation simulates the moon's movement across the sun:
  - **0%**: The moon starts to the right of the sun (`translate: 100%`), at full size (`scale: 1`).
  - **50%**: The moon reaches the center of the sun (`translate: 0%`), slightly scaled down (`scale: 0.95`), and a glowing `box-shadow` is added to simulate the corona (the glowing part of the sun seen during an eclipse).
  - **100%**: The moon moves to the left of the sun (`translate: -100%`), slightly scaled down again (`scale: 0.9`).
- The animation is set to run infinitely, creating a continuous eclipse effect.

### **Conclusion:**
- This code creates a **lunar eclipse animation** where the moon gradually moves across the sun, causing the sky color to change from light to dark, simulating the phases of an eclipse.
- The `universe` div changes color during the animation, representing the changing light conditions during the eclipse.
- The sun and moon are animated to simulate the moon's passage in front of the sun, with the eclipse effect repeating continuously.
